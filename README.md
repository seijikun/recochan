# recochan
Reco-Chan is a recommendation engine based on the FunkSVD.
This is the approach that Simon Funk used in the Netflix challenge 2006.
As the name may suggest, it's original intention was to make recommendations for animes.

# Recommendations
At the moment, Reco-Chan can produce personal recommendations. In other words: You tell Reco-Chan what user you would like to have anime recommendations for, and Reco-Chan will answer with a list of all animes and corresponding predicted rating (sorted descending by rating).
